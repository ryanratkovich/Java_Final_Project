# Java_Final_Project
All code and assets for a Java Poker game.

- Using the GUI:
	- When it is a players turn, the players buttons will be enabled
	  and will be able to be used on a players turn.
	- To see a players cards, scroll over them to flip them over. Otherwise
	  they will stay hidden.
	- The game dialog box on the right-hand side of the GUI will display 
	  specifics about each players move as well as the winning player at 
	  the end of the game.

- How to Play:
	- Player 1 (bottom of the sceen) starts the game.
	- Player 1 starts the game by choosing to Check, Raise, or Fold.
	- The game continues by taking turns between players one-by-one.
	- The game is over when all cards are dealt and betting is over, or 
	  when a player folds.
